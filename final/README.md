### About this document

This is the README for the Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers webpage. For detailed information about the included libraries, take a look at final.pdf - that will have what you're looking for. This document is intended for the end-user of the assembled Fresh Tomatoes package.

### Using this code

This code is dependant on the [Python programming Language](https://www.python.org/) - please make sure you have that installed before you continue. It is also important that you have the Python 'webbrowser' library for web functionality.

The code provided will run fine as is. To modify your personal movies list, just add new movies to the bestFilms.txt file. It is important you follow the markdown below, otherwise the code will not work as intended. As of this version, there is no debugger to inform you your code doesn't work - if you can't see your updates, check your markdown for errors first.

```
<movie name>; <cover art name>; <YouTube unique id>; <comma seperated list of actors>; <release date in plain english>; <your rating of the film>
```

All cover art should exist in the _images_ directory. The YouTube unique ID can be found at the end of any YouTube video URL, after _?watch=v_. Please include a space after the comma following each actors name.

To view your new page, just run _entertainment_center.py_!
