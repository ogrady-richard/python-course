#### A - Drawing with Turtles

The purpose of lesson 2A in this course is to familiarize oneself with the idea of Python classes. This particular section deals with Turtles, which is a simple python package that implements the traditional Turtle Graphics programming tool developed in 1966 as a way of teaching intry-level program design ([1](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html)). We will be doing a variety of projects with Turtles within this section.

**Special thanks to [Willow Systems Corp](http://willow-systems.com/)** for their MIT Licenced [jSignature](http://willowsystems.github.io/jSignature/#/about/) app - digitizing my initials for the final mini project would have been much more difficult without thier help.

This section was completed on Sunday, April 19th.
